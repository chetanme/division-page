We have developed a record linkage system called Active Atlas which compares the objects' shared attributes in order to identify matching objects. Certain attributes are more important for deciding if a mapping should exist between two objects. Previous methods of object identification have required manual construction of object identification rules or mapping rules for determining the mappings between objects. This manual process is time consuming and error-prone. In our approach, Active Atlas learns to tailor mapping rules, through limited user input, to a specific application domain. Within a single site, entities (e.g., people, places, countries, companies, etc.) are usually named in a consistent fashion. However, across sites, the same entities may be referred to with different names.</td>

          <td class="main_page_text" align="justify">Our approach is to select a primary source for an entity's name and then provide a mapping from that source to each of the other sources where a different naming scheme is used. One way to do this is to create a mapping table, which specifies for each entry in one data source what the equivalent entity is called in another data source. Alternatively, if the mapping is computable, it can be represented by a mapping function, which is a program that converts one form into another form.</td>

The method attempts to pair each entity in one source with a corresponding entity (or entities, in some cases) in another source. The basic idea is to use information retrieval techniques to provide an initial mapping, and then to apply machine learning techniques to improve the mapping. The initial mapping matches entities from two sources based on their textual similarity. In the subsequent learning phase, the system learns two types of rules to help improve/verify the initial mapping. Transformation rules identify textual transformations like acronyms, abbreviations, and phrase orderings that are common in the domain. For instance, the system can learn that "Rep" is a commonly used abbrievation for ``Republic'', or that one source commonly employs acronyms, or that one source represents person names as "LastName, Firstname", while the other uses "FirstName LastName". The system also learns Mapping rules which are used when we can compare entities along multiple attributes.</td>

Then the system attempts to learn new rules, and selects additional pairs for the human to verify. The system selects the pairs that will be most valuable for confirming/disconfirming the hypotheses explored by the learning algorithm. The goal is to obtain a mapping for which the system is highly confident, while minimizing the time the human must spend.</td>

In our research of record linkage, we have found that there exists a "grey" area in the classification of potential matches. A record linkage system is able to classify obvious matches and non-matches. However, a class of potential matches is also present. This class needs to be dealt with in a different and more compelling manner.</td>

Breaking up the field into the area code and telephone exchange, it should determine that the telephone number is matched even though the area codes are not the same. With the availability of a secondary source which contains a telephone area code's history, it could determine that the phone numbers in question are in fact the same since one area code is the successor of the other.</td>
